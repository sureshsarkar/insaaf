                    for
                    the legal assistance provided by the external lawyers and legal experts. We are a technology
                    platform enabling legal service providers to provide online legal services to clients through our
                    platform. Insaaf99 has no control over the services provided by the legal expert registered on our
                    platform. The user is solely responsible for assessing the integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness
                    of
                    all legal experts with whom the user communicates on the Insaaf99 platform.</p>

                    the communication between legal experts and the users. Online service taken by the User or any
                    electronic communication exchanged with the User will not create a lawyer-client relationship
                    between the user and Insaaf99.</p>
                <p>In all cases, Insaaf99 will not influence or interfere in any way with any lawyer’s independent

                    order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number
                    provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in

                <p>We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Service or on any
                    related website, including without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No

                <h5><b>SECTION 12 - PROHIBITED USES</b></h5>
                <p>By purchasing or downloading forms and legal documents from Insaaf99, the User agrees that the
                    Documents may only be used by the User for the User’s personal or business use or used by the
                    User in connection with the User’s client and may not be sold or redistributed without the express
                    written consent of Insaaf99.</p>
                <p>Insaaf99 grants the User a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our
                    forms and legal document templates (the “Documents”) for the User’s own personal, internal
                    business use, or if the User is an attorney or professional, for the User’s client. Except as
                    otherwise provided, the User acknowledges and agrees that the User has no right to modify, edit,
                    copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit
                    any of the Forms in any manner, except for modifications in using the Documents for the User’s
                    authorized use. The User shall not remove any copyright notice from any Document.</p>
                <h5><b>SECTION 13 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></h5>
                <p>Insaaf99 is not an agent of lawyers and not a law firm and therefore it does not offer all the
                    services performed by a lawyer. Insaaf99 will not be responsible in cases of any
                    issue/discrepancy with the services provided by the Lawyer. Insaaf99 shall not be liable for
                    any damage or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of
                    such online services</p>
                <p>Insaaf99 strives to keep the information published on the Site accurate, current and up-to-
                    date. However, because the law changes quickly, Insaaf99 does not guarantee that all of the

                    information published on the Site or Applications is correct, complete or up to date.
                    Furthermore, the legal information contained on the Site and Applications is not legal
                    advice. Therefore, nothing on our website or material sent to you in our communication is
                    to be construed as legal advice.</p>
                <p>Insaaf99 does not involve itself in the legal consultation or discussions during drafting of
                    agreements between lawyers and clients. Therefore, Insaaf99 cannot ensure the correctness
                    or the completeness of the agreement or the integrity of either party.</p>
                <p>Insaaf99 offers limited legal services through its Site; so if the User’s particular problem is
                    too complicated to be addressed by our standard limited use service offerings, the User
                    should consult a licensed lawyer in the User’s area.</p>
                <p>This Site and Applications are not intended to create any attorney-client relationship, and
                    the User’s use of Insaaf99 does not and will not create any attorney-client relationship
                    between the User and Insaaf99. Communication exchanged between the User and the legal
                    expert through the Insaaf99 Site will therefore not be protected as privileged
                    communications under the attorney-client privilege.</p>
                <p>The site, applications, and all materials, documents or forms provided on or through the
                    User’s use of the Site or Applications are provided on an “As Is” and “As Available” basis.
                    To the fullest extent permitted by law, Insaaf99 expressly disclaims all warranties of anykind,
                    whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.</p>

                    User’s expectations.</p>
                <p>Obtaining any Materials through the use of the Site or Applications is done at the User’s
                    own discretion and at the User’s own risk. Insaaf99 makes no warranty regarding any
                    products or services purchased or information obtained through the Site or any transactions

                    Except as otherwise provided, the User acknowledges and agrees that the User has no right
                    to modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter,
                    enhance or in any way exploit any of the Forms in any manner, except for modifications in
                    using the Documents for the User’s authorized use. The User shall not remove any
                    copyright notice from any Document.</p>
                <h5><b>SECTION 14 - INDEMNIFICATION</b></h5>
                <p>The user agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Insaaf99 harmless from and against any and all
                    liability and costs incurred in connection with any loss, liability, claim, demand, damage, and
                    expenses arising from or in connection with the contents or use of our services. The user agrees
                    that this defense and indemnity shall also apply to any breach by the user of the agreement or the
                    foregoing representations, warranties, and covenants. The user further agrees that this defense and
                    indemnity shall include without limitation of lawyer’s fees and fees of third parties relating to or
                    arising under this Agreement. The user also agrees that this defense and indemnity shall apply to
                    Insaaf99, its founders, officers, and employees.</p>
                <h5><b>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</b></h5>
                <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or
                    unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
                    applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of
