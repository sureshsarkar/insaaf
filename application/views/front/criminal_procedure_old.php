                (2) Such order shall authorize the attachment of any property belonging to such person within the

                property is situate.

                (3) If the property ordered to be attached is a debt or other movable property, the attachment under
                this section shall be made;

                (a) by seizure; or

                interest is not liable to attachment under this section, the claim or objection shall be inquired into,
                and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part:

                Provided that any claim preferred or objection made within the period allowed by this sub-section may,
                in the event of the death of the claimant or objector, be continued by his legal representative.

                (6B) Claims or objections under sub-section (6A) may be preferred or made in the Court by which the
                order of attachment is issued or, if the claim or objection is in respect of property attached under an
                order endorsed by a District Magistrate in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2), in the
                Court of such Magistrate. (6C) Every such claim or objection shall be inquired into by the Court in
                which it is preferred or made: (.......]

                Provided that, if it is preferred or made in the Court of a District Magistrate such Magistrate may make
                it over for disposal to any Magistrate subordinate to him.

                (6D) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an order under
                sub-section (6A) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order, institute a suit to
                establish the right which he claims in respect of property in dispute; but subject to the result of such
                suit, if any, the order shall be conclusive.

                (6E) If the proclaimed person appears within the time specified in the proclamation the Court shall make
                an order releasing the property from the attachment.

                (7) If the proclaimed person does not appear within the time specified in the proclamation, the property
                under attachment shall be at the disposal of the

                Provincial Government, but it shall not be sold until the expiration of six months from the date of the
                attachment and until any claim preferred or objection made under sub-section (6A) has been disposed of
                under that subsection, unless it is subject to speedy and natural decay, or the Court considers that the
                sale would be for the benefit of the owner, in either of which cases the Court may cause it to be sold
                whenever it thinks fit.

                arrested by any police-officer without warrant, and shall thereupon be produced before the District
                Magistrate. Unless such person then gives security in accordance with the terms of the original order

                ingredients of any offence. In order to obtain benefit of S. 132 the accused has to prove that the acts
                complained of were done under circumstances mentioned in the section, He need not prove that he
                committed no offence. In other words he must place before the Judge materials and circumstances
                justifying an inference that there was an unlawful assembly and the acts complained of were purported to
                have been done while dispersing that assembly. AIR 1956 S.C. 44

                party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law, and forbidding
                all disturbance of such possession until such eviction and when he proceeds under the first proviso to
                sub-section (4), may restore to possession the party forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed.

                may make an order for the proper custody or sale of such property, and, upon the completion of the
                inquiry, shall make such order for the disposal of such property, or the sale-proceeds thereof as he
                thinks fit.

                (9) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, at any stage of the proceedings under this section, on the
                application of either party, issue a summons to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any
                document or thing.

                investigation not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, shall apply to the Magistrate in that behalf and the
                Magistrate may, for the reasons to be recorded in writing, permit taking of accused out of the prison in
