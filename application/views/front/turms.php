                <p>By using our Services, the User is agreeing to be bound by these General Terms as well as our Privacy
                    Policy. The User also agrees that by using the Site and/or any Applications, and the services, the

                <h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>
                <p>Insaaf99 is an internet portal that facilitates online delivery of legal service by a legal
                    professional to the potential users of legal services. Insaaf99 is in no way, directly or indirectly
                    responsible for the legal assistance provided by the external lawyers and legal experts. We are a
                    technology platform enabling legal service providers to provide online legal services to clients
                    through our platform. Insaaf99 has no control over the services provided by the legal expert
                    registered on our platform. The user is solely responsible for assessing the integrity, honesty, and
                    trustworthiness of all legal experts with whom the user communicates on the Insaaf99 platform.</p>
                <h3><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insaaf99 is not an agent of lawyers and not a law firm and therefore it does not offer all the
                        services performed by a lawyer. Insaaf99 will not be responsible in cases of any
                        issue/discrepancy with the services provided by the Lawyer. Insaaf99 shall not be liable for any
                        damage or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of such online
                        services</li>
                    <li>Insaaf99 strives to keep the information published on the Site accurate, current and up-to-date.
                        However, because the law changes quickly, Insaaf99 does not guarantee that all of the
                        information published on the Site or Applications is correct, complete or up to date.
                        Furthermore, the legal information contained on the Site and Applications is not legal advice.
                        Therefore, nothing on our website or material sent to you in our communication is to be
                        construed as legal advice.</li>
                    <li>Insaaf99 does not involve itself in the legal consultation or discussions during drafting of
                        agreements between lawyers and clients. Therefore, Insaaf99 cannot ensure the correctness or the
                        completeness of the agreement or the integrity of either party.</li>
                    <li>Insaaf99 offers limited legal services through its Site; so if the User’s particular problem is
                        too complicated to be addressed by our standard limited use service offerings, the User should
                        consult a licensed lawyer in the User’s area.</li>
                    <li>This Site and Applications are not intended to create any attorney-client relationship, and the
                        User’s use of Insaaf99 does not and will not create any attorney-client relationship between the
                        User and Insaaf99. Communication exchanged between the User and the legal expert through the
                        Insaaf99 Site will therefore not be protected as privileged communications under the
                        attorney-client privilege.</li>


                </ul>
                <h3><b>INTERACTION WITH LEGAL EXPERTS</b></h3>
                <p>Legal Experts registered on Insaaf99’s websites are neither employees nor agents of Insaaf99. Legal
                    Experts are professionals who are independent practitioners and have agreed to provide online
                    answers, limited consultations and legal documentation services to users of the Insaaf99 Site. Also,
                    Insaaf99 is not a marketing agent of the professional legal experts. It only facilitates the
                    communication between legal experts and the users. Online service taken by the User or any
                    electronic communication exchanged with the User will not create a lawyer-client relationship
                    between the user and Insaaf99.</p>
                <p>In all cases, Insaaf99 will not influence or interfere in any way with any lawyer’s independent
                    professional judgment. External legal experts reserve the right to refuse to offer legal services to
                    the User at their discretion.</p>
                <p>Insaaf99 shall have no responsibility or liability of any kind for any professional services provided
                    by any external lawyer through the Insaaf99 Site, and any use or reliance on such professional
                    services is completely and solely at the User’s own risk.</p>
                <h3><b>USER PRIVACY</b></h3>
                <p>Insaaf99 respects the User’s privacy and therefore all of the User’s personal information provided to
                    Insaaf99, including mobile number and email address, is concealed from all other Users of Insaaf99
                    and is never published as part of the Insaaf99 public database. A complete statement of Insaaf99’s

                    Policy of the Site. The User further consents that the terms and contents of such Privacy Policy are
